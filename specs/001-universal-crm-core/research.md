## Research Notes

### External User Portal Access

The spec mentions "External User [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: portal access?]". We need to determine:

*   Should external users (e.g., customers, partners) have access to a portal?
*   If so, what functionality should be exposed? (e.g., view invoices, submit support requests, access knowledge base)
*   What authentication mechanisms should be used?

### Payment Gateway Integration

The spec asks "[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Payment gateway integration in MVP?]". We need to determine:

*   Should payment gateway integration be included in the minimum viable product (MVP)?
*   If so, which payment gateways should be supported? (e.g., Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay)
*   What level of integration is required? (e.g., basic payment processing, recurring billing, refunds)

### WhatsApp/SMS Integration

The spec mentions "Integration hooks for WhatsApp/SMS [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]". We need to determine:

*   What level of WhatsApp/SMS integration is required? (e.g., sending notifications, two-way communication)
*   Which services should be used? (e.g., Twilio, Vonage, WhatsApp Business API)
*   How should this integration be implemented?
