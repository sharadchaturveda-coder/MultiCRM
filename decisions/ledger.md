- **‚ùå REJECTED**: Decision considered and declined (with rationale)

## üìû Decision Process

2. **Research Options**: Evaluate 2-3 viable alternatives
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Technical, business, and domain experts consulted

5. **Implement & Validate**: Apply decision, measure results
6. **Continuous Review**: Re-evaluate annually or when constraints change
