# MultiCRM Product Meta-Spec

## üìã Product Charter (2025-10-16)

### Core Value Proposition
**MultiCRM**: Enterprise-grade CRM foundation for instant domain specialization. Transform any business requirement into a working CRM system within **1-2 weeks**, not months, while maintaining production-ready multi-tenancy and enterprise security.

### üéØ Definition of "Done"
A complete CRM specialization that:
- Provides full CRUD operations for all business entities
- Implements domain-specific workflows and validations
- Passes all automated tests and quality gates
- Deploys live on production infrastructure
- Serves real users with zero downtime

### üíé Non-Negotiables (Constitutional Constraints)

#### Security & Architecture
- **Schema-Per-Tenant Multi-Tenancy**: PostgreSQL dedicated schemas only. Zero possibility of data leaks.
- **TypeScript Strict Mode Always**: No `any` types, complete compile-time safety.
- **Production-Ready from Day 0**: Every implementation ships with monitoring, error handling, and logging.

#### Performance & UX
- **Sub-500KB Frontend Bundle**: Aggressive optimization for global deployment.
- **Sub-100ms API Response Times**: Efficient queries with proper indexing.
- **Mobile-First UI**: Tailwind CSS ensuring responsive design across all devices.

#### Development Standards
- **90%+ Test Coverage**: Required before merging, enforced by CI/CD.
- **Zero ESLint Errors**: Code quality enforced by pre-commit hooks.
- **Zero Variance from Specifications**: Code must implement spec exactly.

### üë• Stakeholder Archetypes

#### Domain Specialists (Hospital/School/Hotel Managers)
- **Needs**: Working CRM within 2 weeks from requirements gathering
- **Success Metric**: "It works exactly like I described, no more, no less"
- **Pain Point**: Technical jargon - wants business outcomes, not architecture discussions

#### Platform Engineers (DevOps/Infrastructure)
- **Needs**: Enterprise security, horizontal scaling, zero-maintenance deployment
- **Success Metric**: Passes penetration testing, handles 1000+ daily active users
- **Pain Point**: Vendor lock-in - demands total control over code and data

#### Product Architects (System Designers)
- **Needs**: Rapid iteration on domain models without rewriting core systems
- **Success Metric**: Team ships 4+ CRM variations per quarter
- **Pain Point**: Feature creep - demands strict scope control and automated quality gates

#### Individual Developers (Contributors)
- **Needs**: Clear workflow, comprehensive docs, instant setup
- **Success Metric**: "I cloned this, ran setup, and was productive within 30 minutes"
- **Pain Point**: Complex toolchains - demands simple, deterministic processes

### üìä Success Metrics (System Level)

#### Speed Metrics
- **Setup Time**: ‚â§30 minutes from `git clone` to working CRM
- **Specialization Time**: ‚â§2 weeks from domain spec to production deploy
- **iteration Cycle**: ‚â§4 hours from code commit to production

#### Quality Metrics
- **Zero Security Incidents**: Multi-tenant isolation enforced at any scale
- **99.9% Uptime**: Self-healing infrastructure with automated recovery
- **100% Contract Compliance**: Specifications fulfilled exactly, no feature drift

#### Efficiency Metrics
- **10x Faster Development**: Traditional CRM 3-6 months ‚Üí MultiCRM 1-2 weeks
- **90% Code Reuse**: Domain specializations share 90%+ of core architecture
- **Zero Deployment Costs**: Perpetual free-tier compatible

### üõ°Ô∏è Constitutional Principles

Following the [Constitution](../constitution.md), every implementation must adhere to:
- **Library-First Design**: Every feature exposes CLI/API contracts first
- **Test-First Development**: Failing tests written before any code
- **Simplicity Enforcement**: ‚â§3 projects per feature unless mathematically justified
- **Direct Integration**: Use framework features directly, avoid over-abstraction

### üöÄ Evolution Rules

- **Meta-Spec Updates**: Require approval from all stakeholder archetypes
- **Backward Compatibility**: New versions never break existing domain specializations
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features can only add capabilities, never change fundamentals
- **Fork-Free Philosophy**: Problems solved through configuration, not code forking

---

This meta-spec serves as the constitutional preamble. Every feature spec inherits these constraints automatically, ensuring the entire ecosystem evolves coherently toward the core mission: **instant enterprise CRMs for any domain.**
